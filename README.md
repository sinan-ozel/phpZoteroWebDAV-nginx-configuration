# phpZoteroWebDAV-nginx-configuration
A working configuration for phpZoteroWebDAV on nginx

I recently set up my personal Zotero using [phpZoteroWebDAV](https://github.com/krueschan/phpZoteroWebDAV).
Although there is documentation on how to set it up using Apache, I could not find anything about how to
set it up using nginx. I am sharing the configuration file that worked for me in this repo.
